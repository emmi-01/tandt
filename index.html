					It was my first trip with Bhumika Holidays and it was such a good experience. 
					All the arrangements were so good. Our captain made sure everything was perfect the hotel, rooms, camps, travel everything. 
					I met a lot of new people, it was such a diverse group. Everyone was so friendly, 
					I went with 4 friends and ended up having 18 more. Loved the experience. 
					I would really recommend their service for a hassle free trip.
